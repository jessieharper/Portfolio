      "I am an aspiring Junior Software Developer with a drive to learn new skills, and a particular interest in UI and user experience. I am a hardworking, conscientious, and creative problem-solver.\\\nGrowing up in the Internet era, I sparked a fascination withtechnology at an early age, and I created my first, albeit amateurish,website at 12. Like many young people, I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do as my career, but I decided to pursue language studies at university, which is what brought me to sunny Sheffield in 2012.\\\nI started working as a freelance translator and game tester in 2021, translating video game content, and I started thinking more about the posibility of becoming a dev. My interest in tech intensified last year, leading me to start teaching myself Python and exploring coding bootcamps. Facing redundancy in October 2023, I seized the opportunity, promptly enrolling in the Northcoders Software Engineering Bootcamp, aligning with my passion for tech and initiating a career transition.\\\nIf you have any questions or you'd like to get in touch, click here to jump to my contact info!",
